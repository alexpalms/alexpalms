### 🧠 About Me

I am a senior applied AI/ML Engineer with 15 years of experience building intelligent agents through Reinforcement Learning, Multimodal Models, and Simulation. I've had the privilege of delivering production-grade solutions across industries ranging from aerospace and defense to robotics. My work spans Reinforcement Learning, physics-based Modeling and Simulation, and is now expanding into LLMs, VLMs, and VLAMs. I'm focused on combining embodied learning with RL and multimodal AI to tackle real-world challenges.

My passion is right at the intersection of AI, simulation, and decision-making. I focus on:

- 🧭 Reinforcement Learning (online/offline, adversarial, multi-agent)
- 🧠 LLM / VLM / VLAM Fine-Tuning & Alignment (SFT, DPO, RLHF/RLAIF)
- 🛰️ Embodied AI in high-fidelity simulators (Isaac Lab, Genesis)
